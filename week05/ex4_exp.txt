As the task 3, this task is to multithread the program.
The main point is that the runtime lowers as the number of threads increases, which corresponds to the runtime in ex4_res.txt.
But if we compare this results to the results in ex3_res.txt, we can see that the runtime is much longer than the runtime in ex3_res.txt.
It could be because of the overhead of creating threads and the overhead of the mutex lock.
