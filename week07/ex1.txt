First Fit:
Throughput = 239.912571
Time = 0.225082

Best Fit:
Throughput = 133.653880
Time = 0.404029

Worst Fit:
Throughput = 152.396654
Time = 0.354338

The First Fit algorithm is the best one. It has the highest throughput and the lowest time.
The Best Fit algorithm is the worst one. It has the lowest throughput and the highest time.
The Worst Fit algorithm is in the middle. It has the middle throughput and the middle time.
